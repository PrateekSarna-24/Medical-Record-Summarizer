1001,"CC: Difficulty with word finding. HX: This 27y/o RHF experienced sudden onset word finding difficulty and slurred speech on the evening of 2/19/96. She denied any associated dysphagia, diplopia, numbness or weakness of her extremities. She went to sleep with her symptoms on 2/19/96, and awoke with them on 2/20/96. She also awoke with a headache (HA) and mild neck stiffness. She took a shower and her HA and neck stiffness resolved. Throughout the day she continued to have difficulty with word finding and had worsening of her slurred speech. That evening, she began to experience numbness and weakness in the lower right face. She felt like there was a ""rubber-band"" wrapped around her tongue. For 3 weeks prior to presentation, she experienced transient episodes of a ""boomerang"" shaped field cut in the left eye. The episodes were not associated with any other symptoms. One week prior to presentation, she went to a local ER for menorrhagia. She had just resumed taking oral birth control pills one week prior to the ER visit after having stopped their use for several months. Local evaluation included an unremarkable carotid duplex scan. However, a HCT with and without contrast reportedly revealed a left frontal gyriform enhancing lesion. An MRI brain scan on 2/20/96 revealed nonspecific white matter changes in the right periventricular region. EEG reportedly showed diffuse slowing. CRP was reportedly ""too high"" to calibrate. MEDS: Ortho-Novum 7-7-7 (started 2/3/96), and ASA (started 2/20/96). PMH: 1) ventral hernia repair 10 years ago, 2) mild ""concussion"" suffered during a MVA; without loss of consciousness, 5/93, 3) Anxiety disorder, 4) One childbirth. FHX: She did not know her father and was not in contact with her mother. SHX: Lives with boyfriend. Smokes one pack of cigarettes every three days and has done so for 10 years. Consumes 6 bottles of beers, one day a week. Unemployed and formerly worked at an herbicide plant. EXAM: BP150/79, HR77, RR22, 37.4C. MS: A&O to person, place and time. Speech was dysarthric with mild decreased fluency marked by occasional phonemic paraphasic errors. Comprehension, naming and reading were intact. She was able to repeat, though her repetition was occasionally marked by phonemic paraphasic errors. She had no difficulty with calculation. CN: VFFTC, Pupils 5/5 decreasing to 3/3. EOM intact. No papilledema or hemorrhages seen on fundoscopy. No RAPD or INO. There was right lower facial weakness. Facial sensation was intact, bilaterally. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. MOTOR: 5/5 strength throughout with normal muscle bulk and tone. Sensory: No deficits. Coord/Station/Gait: unremarkable. Reflexes 2/2 throughout. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally. Gen Exam: unremarkable. COURSE: CRP 1.2 (elevated), ESR 10, RF 20, ANA 1:40, ANCA <1:40, TSH 2.0, FT4 1.73, Anticardiolipin antibody IgM 10.8GPL units (normal <10.9), Anticardiolipin antibody IgG 14.8GPL (normal<22.9), SSA and SSB were normal. Urine beta-hCG pregnancy and drug screen were negative. EKG, CXR and UA were negative. MRI brain, 2/21/96 revealed increased signal on T2 imaging in the periventricular white matter region of the right hemisphere. In addition, there were subtle T2 signal changes in the right frontal, right parietal, and left parietal regions as seen previously on her local MRI can. In addition, special FLAIR imaging showed increased signal in the right frontal region consistent with ischemia. She underwent Cerebral Angiography on 2/22/96. This revealed decreased flow and vessel narrowing the candelabra branches of the RMCA supplying the right frontal lobe. These changes corresponded to the areas of ischemic changes seen on MRI. There was also segmental narrowing of the caliber of the vessels in the circle of Willis. There was a small aneurysm at the origin of the LPCA. There was narrowing in the supraclinoid portion of the RICA and the proximal M1 and A1 segments. The study was highly suggestive of vasculitis. 2/23/96, Neuro-ophthalmology evaluation revealed no evidence of retinal vasculitic change. Neuropsychologic testing the same day revealed slight impairment of complex attention only. She was started on Prednisone 60mg qd and Tagamet 400mg qhs. On 2/26/96, she underwent a right frontal brain biopsy. Pathologic evaluation revealed evidence of focal necrosis (stroke/infarct), but no evidence of vasculitis. Immediately following the brain biopsy, while still in the recovery room, she experienced sudden onset right hemiparesis and transcortical motor type aphasia. Initial HCT was unremarkable. An EEG was consistent with a focal lesion in the left hemisphere. However, a 2/28/96 MRI brain scan revealed new increased signal on T2 weighted images in a gyriform pattern from the left precentral gyrus to the superior frontal gyrus. This was felt consistent with vasculitis. She began q2month cycles of Cytoxan (1,575mg IV on 2/29/96). She became pregnant after her 4th cycle of Cytoxan, despite warnings to the contrary. After extensive discussions with OB/GYN it was recommended she abort the pregnancy. She underwent neuropsychologic testing which revealed no significant cognitive deficits. She later agreed to the abortion. She has undergone 9 cycles of Cytoxan (one cycle every 2 months) as of 4/97. She had complained of one episode of paresthesias of the LUE in 1/97. MRI then showed no new signs ischemia.","Problem with finding the right words. This 27-year-old woman suddenly had trouble finding words and slurred speech on the evening of February 19, 1996. She did not have difficulty swallowing, double vision, or numbness and weakness in her limbs. She went to bed with these symptoms on February 19, 1996, and woke up with them on February 20, 1996. She also woke up with a headache and mild stiffness in her neck. She took a shower, and her headache and neck stiffness went away. Throughout the day, she continued to have trouble finding words and her slurred speech got worse. That evening, she started to feel numbness and weakness in the lower right part of her face. She felt like there was a rubber band around her tongue. For three weeks before going to the doctor, she had temporary episodes of vision loss in her left eye in the shape of a boomerang. These episodes did not have any other symptoms. One week before going to the doctor, she went to the emergency room for heavy menstrual bleeding. She had started taking birth control pills again one week before the emergency room visit, after not taking them for several months. A test showed that her carotid artery was normal. However, a brain scan showed a lesion in the left frontal gyriform that was growing. Another brain scan revealed some changes in the white matter in the right periventricular region. An EEG showed a slow brain wave pattern. A test showed that her C-reactive protein levels were high. She was taking birth control pills and aspirin. She had a hernia repair surgery 10 years ago, a mild concussion from a car accident in May 1993, an anxiety disorder, and one childbirth. She did not know her father and was not in touch with her mother. She lives with her boyfriend. She smokes one pack of cigarettes every three days for 10 years. She drinks 6 bottles of beer one day a week. She is not working anymore, but she used to work at a herbicide plant. PHYSICAL: Blood pressure is 150/79, heart rate is 77, breathing rate is 22, and temperature is 37.4C. MENTAL: She knows who she is, where she is, and what time it is. She has difficulty speaking, and occasionally uses the wrong word. She can understand, read and name things correctly. She can repeat what someone says, but sometimes uses the wrong word. She can do math without difficulty. CRANIAL NERVES: Vision, facial expression, hearing, and taste are working fine. Her pupils react to light, but the right pupil is smaller. Her eye movements are normal. There are no signs of bleeding or swelling on the retina. No abnormalities were detected when checking the eyes' response to light. She has some weakness on the right side of her face. She can feel touch on both sides of her face. The other cranial nerves are normal. MUSCLES: Her strength and muscle tone are normal. SENSORY: There are no problems with her senses. The person's coordination, balance, and walking were normal. The person's reflexes were normal. The person's toes moved in the right way when touched. The general examination was normal. The person's blood tests showed some elevated levels, but nothing too concerning. A urine test showed no pregnancy or drug use. Tests for heart function, chest X-ray, and urine were normal. An MRI scan of the brain on February 21, 1996 showed increased signals in the white matter area near the fluid-filled spaces of the right side of the brain. Additionally, there were subtle changes in signals in the right front, right side of the brain, and left side of the brain, as previously seen in her local MRI scan. Special imaging called FLAIR showed increased signals in the right front of the brain, indicating a lack of blood flow (ischemia). On February 22, 1996, she had a procedure called Cerebral Angiography. The procedure revealed reduced blood flow and narrowing of the blood vessels supplying the right front part of the brain. These changes matched the areas of decreased blood flow seen on the MRI scan. There was also narrowing in some of the blood vessels in a region called the circle of Willis. There was a small bulging blood vessel at the starting point of a specific artery (LPCA). There was narrowing in the upper part of another artery (RICA) and the nearby segments (M1 and A1). The findings strongly suggested the presence of inflammation in the blood vessels (vasculitis). An eye test showed no damage to the eyes from blood vessel inflammation. A test of mental abilities showed only slight difficulty with complex attention. The person was prescribed Prednisone and Tagamet for treatment. On February 26, 1996, the patient had a sample of her brain removed for testing. Tests showed that a part of her brain had died, but there was no evidence of inflammation. Immediately after the procedure, she suddenly had weakness on the right side of her body and difficulty speaking. Initial brain scans did not show any major problems. An additional brain scan suggested a problem on the left side of the brain. Another brain scan showed more damage on the left side of the brain, which may have been caused by inflammation. Doctors believed that the inflammation may have been caused by an autoimmune disease called vasculitis. The patient started receiving medication called Cytoxan every two months. The patient became pregnant despite being advised against it due to the medication she was taking. After talking with her doctors, she decided to have an abortion. The patient was tested for any cognitive problems and no major issues were found. She eventually decided to have the abortion. As of April 1997, the patient had received nine cycles of Cytoxan. In January 1997, she had one episode of tingling in her left arm. Another brain scan did not show any new signs of damage."

MENTAL STATUS: The patient appears slightly anxious during the interview and exam, but she was alert and oriented. HOSPITAL COURSE: As mentioned above, the patient was admitted on 08/24/2007 to the Transitional Care Unit at XYZ Services for evaluation and rehabilitation. She was seen in consultation by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy and had begun her rehabilitation till recovery. The patient had been properly instructed regarding using the CPM machine and she had been instructed as well to limit each CPM session to two hours. Very early in her hospitalization, the patient enthusiastically used the CPM much longer than two hours and consequently had increased right knee pain. She remarked that she had a better degree of flexibility, but she did report an increased need for pain management. Additionally, she required Ativan and at one point scheduled the doses of Ativan to treat her known history of anxiety disorder. On the fourth hospital day, she was noted to have some rashes about the right upper extremity and right side of her abdomen. The patient reported that this rash was itchy. She reports that she had been doing quite a bit of gardening just prior to surgery and this was most likely contact dermatitis, most likely due to her gardening activities preoperatively. She was treated with betamethasone cream applied to the rash b.i.d. The patient's therapy had progressed and she continued to make a good progress. At one point, the patient reported some insomnia due to right knee pain. She was switched from Percocet to oxycodone SR 20 mg b.i.d. and she had good pain control with this using the Percocet only for breakthrough pain. The DVT prophylaxis was maintained with Lovenox 40 mg subcu daily until the INR was greater than 1.7 and it was discontinued on 08/30/2007 when the INR was 1.92 within therapeutic range. The Coumadin was adjusted accordingly according to the INRs during her hospital course. Early in the hospital course, the patient had reported right calf tenderness and a venous Doppler study obtained on 08/27/2007 showed no DVT bilaterally. Initial laboratory data includes a UA on 08/28/2007, which was negative. Additionally, CBC showed a white count of 6.3, hemoglobin was 12.1, hematocrit was 35.3, and platelets were 278,000. Chemistries were within normal limits. Creatinine was 0.8, BUN was 8, anion gap was slightly decreased at 5, fasting glucose was 102. The remainder of chemistries was unremarkable. The patient continued to make great progress with her therapies so much so that we are anticipating her discharge on Monday, 09/03/2007. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1.

Story: A 61-year-old woman had surgery on her right knee on 08/21/2007 because of joint disease. After the surgery, she received 2 units of her own blood. To prevent blood clots, she was given a combination of Coumadin, Lovenox, SCD boots, and TED stockings. The rest of her recovery went well. She left ABCD Hospital on 08/24/2007 and went to the transitional care unit at XYZ Services for rehab. She had a bowel movement on 08/24/2007 before leaving the hospital. She did not have any urinary problems. She had some pain in her right knee, especially in a specific position. She did not know which position caused the most discomfort. Allergies: None. Medical History: High blood pressure, underactive thyroid, joint disease, acid reflux, anxiety disorder, nerve growth in her feet, and migraines 30 years ago. Medications: Celebrex, Coumadin, Colace, Synthroid, Lovenox, Percocet, Toprol XL, niacin, and trazodone. Exam: Normal temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and oxygen saturation. She had no obvious pain except in her right knee. Head: Normal. Eyes: No yellowing. Eye movements normal. Teeth looked good. Tongue in the middle and no signs of thrush. The thyroid gland in the neck is normal. The trachea is in the middle. The lungs sound clear when listened to with a stethoscope. The heart beats normally. The sounds the heart makes are normal. The belly feels soft and doesn't hurt or look swollen. None of the organs in the belly are bigger than they should be. The incision on the right knee looks good. There are special bandages called Steri-Strips covering the incision. The right knee looks a little swollen and bruised. There's no pain in the calves of the legs. You can feel a pulse in both feet. The patient seems a little nervous, but is alert and aware of their surroundings. The patient was admitted to the hospital on August 24, 2007, for evaluation and rehabilitation. Physical and occupational therapists evaluated the patient and began rehabilitation. The patient was taught how to use a machine to help move their knee, but was told to only use it for two hours at a time. Early on in the hospital stay, the patient used the machine for longer than two hours and had more knee pain. The patient said their knee was more flexible, but needed more pain medicine. The patient also needed medicine for anxiety. On the fourth day in the hospital, the patient had a rash on their right arm and side of their belly. The patient said the rash was itchy. She said she did a lot of gardening before surgery, which probably caused the rash. She was given cream to put on the rash twice a day. The patient's treatment was going well and she was making good progress. At one point, the patient had trouble sleeping because her right knee hurt. Her pain medicine was changed and she felt better, but still needed some extra pain medicine sometimes. The patient was given medicine to prevent blood clots until her blood test showed it was safe to stop. Her blood test results were used to adjust her medicine to prevent blood clots. Early on, the patient's calf was sore and a test showed she didn't have a blood clot. Some lab tests were done and they were normal. Her blood count was normal, too. Her other blood tests were also normal. Some other blood tests were done and they were normal, too. The patient was doing so well that she was going to be able to leave the hospital soon. These are the reasons why the patient was in the hospital and the reasons she was going to leave. REASON FOR LEAVING THE HOSPITAL: The patient had surgery to replace her right knee because of arthritis. The patient has an anxiety disorder. The patient couldn't sleep because of pain and anxiety after surgery. The patient had trouble going to the bathroom after surgery. The patient got a skin rash from gardening before their surgery. The patient has high blood pressure. The patient has an underactive thyroid gland. The patient has a condition where stomach acid goes back up into their throat. The patient has a nerve problem in both feet. The patient had migraines a long time ago. The patient was given instructions when they left the hospital. The patient was told to keep taking certain medications for a period of time. The patient will also take Coumadin, which will be adjusted according to regular blood tests. The patient is currently taking 7mg of Coumadin daily. The patient will take Coumadin for 30 days. If the Coumadin dose changes, a note will be added to the patient's discharge summary. The patient has a follow-up appointment with Dr. A on 09/21/2007. The patient is encouraged to see their regular doctor, Dr. B. The patient is in stable condition and has made good progress after their knee replacement surgery."
1013,EXAM:  Three views of the right ankle. INDICATIONS:  Pain. FINDINGS:  Three views of the right ankle are obtained. There is no evidence of fractures or dislocations. No significant degenerative changes or destructive osseous lesions of the ankle are noted. There is a small plantar calcaneal spur. There is no significant surrounding soft tissue swelling. IMPRESSION:  Negative right ankle.,TEST: Three different pictures of the right ankle were taken. REASON: The person is experiencing pain. RESULTS: Three pictures of the right ankle were taken. There are no signs of broken bones or joint dislocation. There are no major signs of wear and tear or harmful bone lesions in the ankle. A small bone spur is present on the bottom of the heel. There is no significant swelling in the tissues around the ankle. CONCLUSION: The right ankle does not show any concerning issues.
1019,"PROCEDURE:  Colonoscopy. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  Rectal bleeding and perirectal abscess. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Perianal abscess. MEDICATIONS:  MAC. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The Olympus pediatric variable colonoscope was introduced through the rectum and advanced carefully through the colon into the cecum and then through the ileocecal valve into the terminal ileum. The preparation was excellent and all surfaces were well seen. The mucosa throughout the colon and in the terminal ileum was normal, with no evidence of colitis. Special attention was paid to the rectum, including retroflexed views of the distal rectum and the anorectal junction. There was no evidence of either inflammation or a fistulous opening. The scope was withdrawn. A careful exam of the anal canal and perianal area demonstrated a jagged 8-mm opening at the anorectal junction posteriorly (12 o'clock position). Some purulent material could be expressed through the opening. There was no suggestion of significant perianal reservoir of inflamed tissue or undrained material. Specifically, the posterior wall of the distal rectum and anal canal were soft and unremarkable. In addition, scars were noted in the perianal area. The first was a small dimpled scar, 1 cm from the anal verge in the 11 o'clock position. The second was a dimpled scar about 5 cm from the anal verge on the left buttock's cheek. There were no other abnormalities noted. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room. FINAL DIAGNOSES: 1. Normal colonoscopy to the terminal ileum. 2. Opening in the skin at the external anal verge, consistent with drainage from a perianal abscess, with no palpable abscess at this time, and with no evidence of fistulous connection to the bowel lumen. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Continue antibiotics. 2. Followup with Dr. X. 3. If drainage persists, consider surgical drainage.","Procedure: Colonoscopy. Preoperative Diagnosis: Rectal bleeding and abscess near the rectum. Postoperative Diagnosis: Abscess near the anus. Medications: MAC (name of the anesthesia used). Description of Procedure: A small, flexible tube called an Olympus pediatric variable colonoscope was inserted through the rectum and carefully moved through the colon to the end of the small intestine. The preparation for the procedure was good, and the doctor could see all the surfaces clearly. The inner lining of the colon and small intestine looked normal, and there were no signs of inflammation. The doctor paid special attention to the rectum, including looking at it from different angles. There were no signs of inflammation or an abnormal opening. The tube was taken out. A careful examination of the anus and the area around it showed a small 8-mm irregular opening at the back of the anus (like at the 12 o'clock position on a clock). Some pus-like material could be seen coming out of the opening. There were no signs of a significant buildup of inflamed tissue or undrained material around the anus. The back wall of the rectum and anus looked normal and felt soft. Additionally, there were scars in the area around the anus. The first scar was a small indentation about 1 cm away from the edge of the anus at the 11 o'clock position. The second scar was a small indentation about 5 cm away from the edge of the anus on the left side of the buttock. No other abnormalities were found. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room. Final Diagnoses: Normal colonoscopy up to the end of the small intestine. An opening in the skin around the anus, likely from draining the abscess, with no visible abscess at the moment and no connection to the inside of the intestine. Recommendations: Continue taking antibiotics. Follow up with Dr. X. If the drainage continues, consider surgical drainage."
1023,"The patient was taken to the GI lab and placed in the left lateral supine position. Continuous pulse oximetry and blood pressure monitoring were in place during the procedure. After informed consent was obtained, the video endoscope was inserted over the dorsum of the tongue without difficulty. The scope was advanced down the esophagus and into the body of the stomach. The scope was further advanced to the pylorus and into the duodenum. The duodenum was visualized well into its second portion and was free of stricture, neoplasm, or ulceration. Retroflexion view of the fundus was normal without evidence of abnormality. The scope was then slowly removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well.","The patient was taken to a special room for examining the gastrointestinal tract and positioned on their left side. During the procedure, the patient's pulse and oxygen levels were continuously monitored. After getting permission from the patient, a flexible tube with a camera on the end was gently inserted through the back of their tongue. The tube was carefully moved down the throat and into the stomach. The tube was further guided into the first part of the small intestine called the duodenum, passing through the opening called the pylorus. The doctor could see the second part of the duodenum clearly and did not find any narrowing, abnormal growths, or ulcers. When the camera was pointed back towards the upper part of the stomach, everything looked normal without any signs of problems. The tube was slowly taken out. The patient handled the procedure well and did not experience any issues."
1024,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left lateral malleolus fracture. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left lateral malleolus fracture. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Open reduction and internal fixation of left lateral malleolus. ANESTHESIA: General. TOURNIQUET TIME: 59 minutes. COMPLICATIONS: None. BLOOD LOSS: Negligible. CLOSURE: 2-0 Vicryl and staples. INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: This is a young gentleman with soccer injury to his left ankle and an x-ray showed displaced lateral malleolus fracture with widening of the mortise now for ORIF. The risks and perceivable complications of the surgeries were discussed with the patient via a translator as well as nonsurgical treatment options and this was scheduled emergently. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operative room where general anesthesia was successfully introduced. The right ankle was prepped and draped in standard fashion. The tourniquet was applied about the right upper thigh. An Esmarch tourniquet was used to exsanguinate the ankle. The tourniquet was insufflated to a pressure 325 mm for approximately 59 minutes. An approximately 6 inch longitudinal incision was made just over the lateral malleolus. Care was taken to spare overlying nerves and vessels. An elevator was used to expose the fracture. The fracture was freed of old hematoma and reduced with a reducing clamp. An interfragmentary cortical screw was placed of 28 mm with excellent purchase. The intraoperative image showed excellent reduction. A 5-hole semitubular plate was then contoured to the lateral malleolus and fixed with 3 cortical screws proximally and 2 cancellous screws distally. Excellent stability of fracture was achieved. Final fluoroscopy showed a reduction to be anatomic in 2 planes. The wound was irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline. Deep tissue was closed with 2-0 Vicryl. The skin was approximated with 2-0 Vicryl and closed with staples. Dry sterile dressing was applied. The patient tolerated the procedure, was awakened and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.","Before surgery, the patient was diagnosed with a fracture on the left side of the ankle. After surgery, the diagnosis remained the same. The procedure performed was an operation to realign and fix the broken bone on the left side of the ankle. The patient received general anesthesia during the surgery. The tourniquet, a device to control blood flow, was used for about 59 minutes. No complications occurred during the surgery. The amount of blood loss was very small. The wound was closed using special sutures and staples. The surgery was needed because a young man injured his left ankle while playing soccer, and an X-ray showed that the bone was broken and out of place. The surgery was necessary to fix it. The patient was informed about the risks and possible complications of the surgery, as well as alternative nonsurgical treatments. The surgery was scheduled urgently. The patient was taken to the operating room and given general anesthesia successfully. The right ankle was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. A tourniquet was placed around the upper thigh to control blood flow. Another tourniquet was used to remove blood from the ankle. The tourniquet was inflated to a pressure of 325 mmHg for approximately 59 minutes. A 6-inch incision was made directly above the broken bone on the outer side of the ankle. Care was taken to avoid damaging nearby nerves and blood vessels. Special tools were used to expose the fracture. The fracture was cleared of any blood clot and aligned using a clamp. A screw was inserted to hold the bone fragments together. An X-ray taken during the surgery showed that the bone was aligned properly. A metal plate was attached to the outer side of the ankle using screws. The fracture was now stable and in the correct position. A final X-ray confirmed that the bone was aligned correctly. The wound was rinsed with a large amount of sterile saltwater. The deep tissues were closed using special sutures. The skin was stitched using sutures and staples. A clean bandage was applied. The patient handled the surgery well, woke up, and was moved to the recovery room in stable condition."
1026,"CC: Seizures. HX: The patient was initially evaluated at UIHC at 7 years of age. He had been well until 7 months prior to evaluation when he started having spells which were described as ""dizzy spells"" lasting from several seconds to one minute in duration. They occurred quite infrequently and he was able to resume activity immediately following the episodes. The spell became more frequent and prolonged, and by the time of initial evaluation were occurring 2-3 times per day and lasting 2-3 minutes in duration. In addition, in the 3 months prior to evaluation, the right upper extremity would become tonic and flexed during the episodes, and he began to experience post ictal fatigue. BIRTH HX: 32 weeks gestation to a G4 mother and weighed 4#11oz. He was placed in an incubator for 3 weeks. He was jaundiced, but there was no report that he required treatment. PMH: Single febrile convulsion lasting ""3 hours"" at age 2 years. MEDS: none. EXAM: Appears healthy and in no acute distress. Unremarkable general and neurologic exam. Impression: Psychomotor seizures. Studies: Skull X-Rays were unremarkable. EEG showed ""minimal spike activity during hyperventilation, as well as random sharp delta activity over the left temporal area, in drowsiness and sleep. This record also showed moderate amplitude asymmetry (left greater than right) over the frontal central and temporal areas, which is a peculiar finding."" COURSE: The patient was initially treated with Phenobarbital; then Dilantin was added (early 1970's); then Depakene was added (early 1980's) due to poor seizure control. An EEG on 8/22/66 showed ""Left mid-temporal spike focus with surrounding slow abnormality, especially posterior to the anterior temporal areas (sparing the parasagittal region). In addition, the right lateral anterior hemisphere voltage is relatively depressed. ...this suggests two separate areas of cerebral pathology."" He underwent his first HCT scan in Sioux City in 1981, and this revealed an right temporal arachnoid cyst. The patient had behavioral problems throughout elementary/junior high/high school. He underwent several neurosurgical evaluations at UIHC and Mayo Clinic and was told that surgery was unwarranted. He was placed on numerous antiepileptic medication combinations including Tegretol, Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Depakote, Acetazolamide, and Mysoline. Despite this he averaged 2-3 spells a month. He was last seen, 6/19/95, and was taking Dilantin and Tegretol. His typical spells were described as sudden in onset and without aura. He frequently becomes tonic or undergoes tonic-clonic movement and falls with associated loss of consciousness. He usually has rapid recovery and can return to work in 20 minutes. He works at a Turkey packing plant. Serial HCT scans showed growth in the arachnoid cyst until 1991, when growth arrest appeared to have occurred.","CC: Seizures. HX: The patient was first checked at UIHC when they were 7 years old. They were fine until 7 months before the check-up when they started having episodes described as ""dizzy spells."" These spells lasted from a few seconds to a minute. The spells didn't happen often, and they could continue with their activities immediately after. Over time, the spells became more frequent and lasted longer. By the time of the check-up, they were happening 2-3 times a day and lasted 2-3 minutes. In the 3 months before the check-up, the patient's right arm would become stiff and bent during the episodes. They also experienced fatigue after the episodes. BIRTH HX: The patient was born prematurely at 32 weeks to a mother who had been pregnant four times before. They weighed 4 pounds and 11 ounces. They spent three weeks in an incubator. The patient had jaundice, but there's no mention of any treatment being needed. PMH: They had a single fever-related seizure that lasted for ""3 hours"" when they were 2 years old. MEDS: They aren't currently taking any medications. EXAM: The patient looks healthy and isn't showing any signs of distress. The general and neurological examination didn't reveal anything unusual. Impression: The patient has psychomotor seizures. Studies: X-rays of the skull didn't show any abnormalities. An EEG showed minimal spike activity when hyperventilating, as well as random sharp delta activity over the left temporal area during drowsiness and sleep. The EEG also showed moderate asymmetry (the left side being more active than the right) in the frontal central and temporal areas, which is a peculiar finding. COURSE: Initially, the patient was treated with Phenobarbital. Later on, Dilantin was added in the early 1970s, and then Depakene was added in the early 1980s due to poor control of the seizures. An EEG on 8/22/66 showed a spike focus in the left mid-temporal area with slow abnormality surrounding it, particularly behind the front part of the temporal areas (excluding the center region). Additionally, the voltage in the right front part of the brain is relatively low. ...this suggests two different areas of brain pathology. In 1981, the patient had their first head CT scan in Sioux City, which revealed an arachnoid cyst in the right temporal area. The patient had behavioral issues throughout elementary, junior high, and high school. They had several neurosurgical evaluations at UIHC and Mayo Clinic and were told that surgery wasn't necessary. They were prescribed various combinations of antiepileptic medications, including Tegretol, Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Depakote, Acetazolamide, and Mysoline. Despite the medications, they still experienced 2-3 episodes per month. Their last visit was on 6/19/95, and they were taking Dilantin and Tegretol. The typical episodes started suddenly without any warning signs. They often experience stiffness or jerking movements and fall down with loss of consciousness. They usually recover quickly and can go back to work within 20 minutes. They work at a turkey packing plant. Subsequent head CT scans showed that the arachnoid cyst grew until 1991, after which its growth seemed"

ANESTHESIA: Local anesthesia 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine. INDICATIONS: I was consulted by Dr. X for this patient with bilateral temporal headaches to rule out temporal arteritis. I explained fully the procedure to the patient. PROCEDURE: Both sides were done exactly the same way. After 1% Xylocaine infiltration, a 2 to 3-cm incision was made over the temporal artery. The temporal artery was identified and was grossly normal on both sides. Proximal and distal were ligated with both of 3-0 silk suture and Hem-o-Lok. The specimen of temporal artery was taken from both sides measuring at least 2 to 3 cm. They were sent as separate specimens, right and left labeled. The wound was then closed with interrupted 3-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures and Dermabond. She tolerated the procedure well.","Reason for surgery: Checking for temporal arteritis. After surgery: Still checking for temporal arteritis. Procedure: Biopsy of both temporal arteries. Type of anesthesia used: Local anesthesia with numbing medication. Reasons for the procedure: The patient had headaches on both sides of their head, so we wanted to rule out temporal arteritis. I explained the procedure to the patient in detail. The procedure was done the same way on both sides. After numbing the area with medication, a small incision (about 2 to 3 cm long) was made over the temporal artery. The temporal artery was found and looked normal on both sides. The upper and lower parts of the artery were tied off using sutures and clips. A sample of the temporal artery (measuring at least 2 to 3 cm) was taken from both sides. The samples were labeled and sent separately for analysis. The incision was closed using stitches under the skin and a special glue. The patient did well during the procedure and tolerated it without any problems."

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: A gentleman who is here today requesting voluntary sterility. Options were discussed for voluntary sterility and he has elected to proceed with a bilateral vasectomy. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room, and after appropriately identifying the patient, the patient was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion and placed in a supine position on the OR table. Then, 0.25% Marcaine without epinephrine was used to anesthetize the scrotal skin. A small incision was made in the right hemiscrotum. The vas deferens was grasped with a vas clamp. Next, the vas deferens was skeletonized. It was clipped proximally and distally twice. The cut edges were fulgurated. Meticulous hemostasis was maintained. Then, 4-0 chromic was used to close the scrotal skin on the right hemiscrotum. Next, the attention was turned to the left hemiscrotum, and after the left hemiscrotum was anesthetized appropriately, a small incision was made in the left hemiscrotum. The vas deferens was isolated. It was skeletonized. It was clipped proximally and distally twice. The cut edges were fulgurated. Meticulous hemostasis was maintained. Then, 4-0 chromic was used to close the scrotal skin. A jockstrap and sterile dressing were applied at the end of the case. Sponge, needle, and instruments counts were correct.","Before the surgery, the patient wanted to become sterile on purpose. After the surgery, the patient became sterile as intended. The surgery performed was a procedure to block the tubes that carry sperm on both sides. The patient received local anesthesia to numb the area. The reason for the surgery was the patient's desire to become sterile. The patient chose to have a surgery called bilateral vasectomy to become sterile. The patient was taken to the operating room and prepared for surgery while lying on their back. The scrotal skin was numbed using a medication called Marcaine without epinephrine. A small cut was made on the right side of the scrotum. A tool called a vas clamp was used to hold the tube called the vas deferens. The vas deferens was carefully exposed. It was clipped twice at different points to block it. The cut ends were sealed using heat. Care was taken to prevent bleeding. The incision on the right side of the scrotum was closed using a type of thread called 4-0 chromic. The same process was repeated on the left side of the scrotum after numbing it. The left vas deferens was isolated. It was carefully exposed. It was clipped twice to block it. The cut ends were sealed using heat. Care was taken to prevent bleeding. The incision on the left side of the scrotum was closed using 4-0 chromic thread. At the end of the surgery, a supportive underwear and a sterile dressing were applied. All sponges, needles, and instruments used in the surgery were properly counted and none were left behind."
1034,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gastrostomy (gastrocutaneous fistula). POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gastrostomy (gastrocutaneous fistula). OPERATION PERFORMED: Surgical closure of gastrostomy. ANESTHESIA: General. INDICATIONS: This 1-year-old child had a gastrostomy placed due to feeding difficulties. Since then, he has reached a point where he is now eating completely by mouth and no longer needed the gastrostomy. The tube was, therefore, removed, but the tract has not shown signs of spontaneous closure. He, therefore, comes to the operating room today for surgical closure of his gastrostomy. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: After the induction of general anesthetic, the abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual manner. An elliptical incision was made around the gastrostomy site and carried down through skin and subcutaneous tissue with sharp dissection. The tract and the stomach were freed. Stay sutures were then placed on either side of the tract. The tract was amputated. The intervening stomach was then closed with interrupted #4-0 Lembert, Nurolon sutures. The fascia was then closed over the stomach using #3-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was closed with #5-0 subcuticular Monocryl. A dressing was applied, and the child was awakened and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.","Preoperative Diagnosis: The child has a hole between the stomach and the skin (gastrostomy). Postoperative Diagnosis: The child still has the hole between the stomach and the skin (gastrostomy). Operation Performed: Surgery to close the hole between the stomach and the skin (gastrostomy). Anesthesia: The child was given general anesthesia. Reasons for Surgery: The child had difficulty with feeding, so a tube was inserted to help with food intake. The child has improved and can now eat normally without the tube. The tube was removed, but the hole didn't close on its own. The child came to the operating room for surgery to close the hole. Procedure: After giving anesthesia, the abdomen was cleaned and covered. An incision was made around the hole, and the area was carefully dissected. The connection between the hole and the stomach was separated. Stitches were placed on both sides of the hole. The hole was removed. The gap in the stomach was closed with stitches. The layer below the stomach was closed with different stitches. The skin was closed with stitches placed underneath. A dressing was applied, and the child woke up and was taken to the recovery room in good condition."

1041,"REASON FOR EXAM: Left arm and hand numbness. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast axial CT images of the head were obtained with 5 mm slice thickness. FINDINGS: There is an approximately 5-mm shift of the midline towards the right side. Significant low attenuation is seen throughout the white matter of the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. There is loss of the cortical sulci on the right side. These findings are compatible with edema. Within the right parietal lobe, a 1.8 cm, rounded, hyperintense mass is seen. No hydrocephalus is evident. The calvarium is intact. The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear. IMPRESSION: A 5 mm midline shift to the left side secondary to severe edema of the white matter of the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. A 1.8 cm high attenuation mass in the right parietal lobe is concerning for hemorrhage given its high density. A postcontrast MRI is required for further characterization of this mass. Gradient echo imaging should be obtained.","REASON FOR EXAM: The person is experiencing numbness in their left arm and hand. TECHNIQUE: Pictures of the head were taken using a special scan that doesn't require contrast dye, with each slice being 5 millimeters thick. FINDINGS: The center line of the brain appears to have shifted about 5 millimeters towards the right side. There are areas of reduced brightness in the white matter of the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. The grooves on the surface of the brain are not clearly visible on the right side. These findings indicate the presence of swelling. In the right parietal lobe, there is a round mass measuring 1.8 centimeters with high intensity on the scan. There is no evidence of excess fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus). The skull is intact. The sinuses next to the nose appear normal. IMPRESSION: The brain has shifted 5 millimeters to the left due to severe swelling in the white matter of the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. The presence of a 1.8 centimeter mass in the right parietal lobe, which appears brighter, raises concerns about possible bleeding. A follow-up MRI with contrast is needed to get more information about this mass. A specific type of imaging called gradient echo should be performed."

1054,"ENDOVASCULAR BRACHYTHERAPY (EBT) The patient is to undergo a course of angioplasty for in-stent restenosis. The radiotherapy will be planned using simulation films when the Novoste system catheter markers are placed on either side of the coronary artery injury site. After this, a calculation will take place to determine the length of time at which the strontium sources will be left in place to deliver an adequate dose given the reference vessel diameter. The rationale for this treatment is based on radiobiological principles that make this type of therapy more effective than blade atherectomy or laser atherectomy. The dose per fraction is individualized for each patient according to radiobiological principles and reference vessel diameter. Given that this is a very high dose rate source and the chances of severe acute toxicity such as cardiac ischemia and machine malfunction are present, it is imperative that the patient be followed closely by myself and monitored for ST segment elevation and correct machine function.","ENDOVASCULAR BRACHYTHERAPY (EBT): It's a medical procedure that uses radiation therapy inside blood vessels. The patient needs angioplasty to treat a narrowing in a stent. To plan the radiation therapy, special markers are placed near the injured area of the heart's blood vessel, and X-ray films are taken to guide the treatment. Then, a calculation is done to determine how long the radioactive strontium sources should be left in place to deliver the right amount of radiation based on the size of the blood vessel. This treatment is considered more effective than other methods like blade atherectomy or laser atherectomy, based on scientific principles related to radiation and biology. The radiation dose is adjusted for each patient based on their blood vessel size and scientific principles related to radiation and biology. Since there are risks of severe side effects like heart problems and machine issues, it's important for me to closely follow the patient's progress and monitor for certain signs like ST segment elevation and proper machine function."
1056,"PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Following a barium enema prep and lidocaine ointment to the rectal vault, perirectal inspection and rectal exam were normal. The Olympus video colonoscope then introduced into the rectum and passed by directed vision to the distal descending colon. Withdrawal notes an otherwise normal descending, rectosigmoid and rectum. Retroflexion noted no abnormality of the internal ring. No hemorrhoids were noted. Withdrawal from the patient terminated the procedure.","Detailed Procedure: After preparing the patient with a barium enema and applying numbing ointment to the rectal area, the doctor examined the area around the rectum and performed a rectal exam, which showed no abnormalities. Next, a special colonoscope made by Olympus was inserted into the rectum and guided visually to the lower part of the colon. As the colonoscope was slowly pulled back, the doctor observed that the descending colon, rectosigmoid, and rectum appeared normal. The doctor also checked for any abnormalities in the internal ring by bending the colonoscope backward, but found none. No hemorrhoids were detected during the examination. The procedure was completed by removing the colonoscope from the patient's body."

1068,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right spermatocele. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right spermatocele. OPERATIONS PERFORMED: 1. Right spermatocelectomy. 2. Right orchidopexy. ANESTHESIA: Local MAC. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. FLUIDS: Crystalloid. BRIEF HISTORY OF THE PATIENT: The patient is a 77-year-old male who comes to the office with a large right spermatocele. The patient says it does bother him on and off, has occasional pain and discomfort with it, has difficulty with putting clothes on etc. and wanted to remove. Options such as watchful waiting, removal of the spermatocele or needle drainage were discussed. Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, risk of infection, scrotal pain, and testicular pain were discussed. The patient was told that his scrotum may enlarge in the postoperative period for about a month and it will settle down. The patient was told about the risk of recurrence of spermatocele. The patient understood all the risks, benefits, and options and wanted to proceed with removal. DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient's scrotal area was shaved, prepped, and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A midline scrotal incision was made measuring about 2 cm in size. The incision was carried through the dartos through the scrotal sac and the spermatocele was identified. All the layers of the spermatocele were removed. Clear layer was visualized, was taken all the way up to the base, the base was tied. Entire spermatocele sac was removed. After removing the entire spermatocele sac, hemostasis was obtained. The testicle was not in normal orientation. The testis and epididymis was removed, which is a small appendage on the superior aspect of the testicle. The testicle was placed in a normal orientation. Careful attention was drawn not to twist the cord. Orchidopexy was done to allow the testes to stay stable in the postoperative period using 4-0 Vicryl and was tied at 3 different locations. Absorbable sutures were used, so that the patient does not feel the sutures in the postoperative period. The dartos was closed using 2-0 Vicryl in running locking fashion. There was excellent hemostasis. The skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl. Dermabond was applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient was brought to the recovery room in stable condition.","Before Surgery Diagnosis: The patient had a problem with their right sperm sac. After Surgery Diagnosis: The patient still had the same problem with their right sperm sac. Surgeries Done: Removed the right sperm sac cyst (spermatocelectomy). Fixed the right testicle (orchidopexy). Type of Anesthesia: The patient was partly asleep and numbed only in the surgical area. Amount of Blood Lost: Very little. Fluids Given: Gave a special saltwater solution. Patient's Background: A 77-year-old man came to the doctor's office with a big lump in his right sperm sac. Patient's Complaints: The patient mentioned that this lump bothered him at times. He experienced occasional pain, discomfort, and had trouble putting on clothes. He wanted it removed. Choices Discussed: The patient and the doctor talked about different options, like waiting, removing the lump, or using a needle to drain it. Risks Explained: The doctor explained the possible problems, like feeling unwell from the anesthesia, bleeding, infections, pain, heart issues (MI), blood clot risks (DVT and PE), more infections, and pain in the scrotum and testicles. Scrotum May Get Bigger: The patient was told that his scrotum might swell up for about a month after the surgery, but it will go back to normal. Risk of Lump Coming Back: The patient was informed that the lump might return. Patient's Decision: The patient understood all the information about the risks, benefits, and choices, and chose to have the lump removed. Procedure Details: The patient was taken to the operating room (OR). Using Anesthesia: They gave the patient medicine to make him numb or fall asleep. Preparing the Area: They shaved the patient's scrotum area, cleaned it, and covered it with a sterile sheet. Cutting the Skin: The doctor made a small 2 cm cut in the middle of the scrotum. Finding the Lump: They went through the skin, a layer called dartos, and reached the lump (spermatocele). Removing All Layers: They took out all the layers of the lump. Clear Layer Seen: They saw a clear layer and removed it all the way down to the bottom, then tied the bottom. Removing the Whole Lump: They got rid of the entire lump. Stopping Any Bleeding: After taking out the whole lump, they stopped any bleeding. Testicle in Wrong Position: The testicle wasn't in the right place. Removing Extra Parts: They removed a small part called the epididymis from the top of the testicle. Putting Testicle Back Right: They put the testicle in its correct position. Being Careful Not to Twist: They made sure not to twist the cord that holds the testicle. Fixing Testicle in Place: They used special thread (Vicryl) to keep the testicle steady after surgery, tying it at three different spots. Dissolvable Stitches Used: They used stitches that would disappear over time, so the patient wouldn't feel them later. Closing the Layer Under the Skin: They used special thread (Vicryl) to stitch up the layer under the skin in a way that locks securely. Stopped Any Bleeding Very Well: They made sure there was no more bleeding. Closing the Skin: They stitched up the skin using a different type of thread (Monocryl). Using Skin Glue: They applied a special skin glue called Dermabond. Patient Did Well During the Procedure: The patient did fine while the doctor was doing the surgery. Patient Taken to Recovery Room Safely: They moved the patient to a special room for recovery, and the patient was stable (doing well)."
1071,"DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. Bilateral lower extremity cellulitis secondary to bilateral tinea pedis. 2. Prostatic hypertrophy with bladder outlet obstruction. 3. Cerebral palsy. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient would be discharged on his usual Valium 10-20 mg at bedtime for spasticity, Flomax 0.4 mg daily, cefazolin 500 mg q.i.d., and Lotrimin cream between toes b.i.d. for an additional two weeks. He will be followed in the office. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a pleasant 62-year-old male with cerebral palsy. The patient was recently admitted to Hospital with lower extremity cellulitis. This resolved, however, recurred in both legs. Examination at the time of this admission demonstrated peeling of the skin and excoriation between all of his toes on both feet consistent with tinea pedis. PAST MEDICAL/FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY: As per the admission record. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As per the admission record. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: As per the admission record. LABORATORY STUDIES: At the time of admission, his white blood cell count was 8200 with a normal differential, hemoglobin 13.6, hematocrit 40.6 with normal indices, and platelet count was 250,000. Comprehensive metabolic profile was unremarkable, except for a nonfasting blood sugar of 137, lactic acid was 0.8. Urine demonstrated 4-9 red blood cells per high-powered field with 2+ bacteria. Blood culture and wound cultures were unremarkable. Chest x-ray was unremarkable. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the General Medical floor and treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and topical Lotrimin. On this regimen, his lower extremity edema and erythema resolved quite rapidly. Because of urinary frequency, a bladder scan was done suggesting about 600 cc of residual urine. A Foley catheter was inserted and was productive of approximately 500 cc of urine. The patient was prescribed Flomax 0.4 mg daily. 24 hours later, the Foley catheter was removed and a bladder scan demonstrated 60 cc of residual urine after approximately eight hours. At the time of this dictation, the patient was ambulating minimally, however, not sufficiently to resume independent living.","Reasons for leaving the hospital: Infection in both lower legs caused by a fungal infection in both feet. Enlarged prostate causing a blockage in the urinary bladder. A condition called cerebral palsy. Instructions after leaving the hospital: The patient will continue taking their regular Valium at night to help with muscle stiffness (10-20 mg), Flomax daily (0.4 mg) for the prostate issue, cefazolin four times a day (500 mg), and Lotrimin cream applied between the toes twice a day for two more weeks. The patient will have follow-up appointments in the doctor's office. History of the recent health issue: This is a friendly 62-year-old man with cerebral palsy. The patient was recently in the hospital for an infection in both lower legs. The infection got better, but then came back in both legs. When examined during this hospital stay, there was peeling skin and irritation between the toes on both feet, which is due to a fungal infection called tinea pedis. Medical, family, and social background: We have the information from when the patient was first admitted. Checking how the body is doing: We've already looked into this, as documented during the admission. Physical check-up: We did a physical exam as part of the admission process. Blood tests when the patient was admitted showed normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count. The overall results of metabolic tests were normal, except for slightly high blood sugar when not fasting (137) and a measure of lactic acid (0.8). The urine test showed a small amount of red blood cells and some bacteria. Tests of blood and wound samples didn't show any significant issues. The chest X-ray didn't reveal any problems. During the hospital stay, the patient received antibiotics through an IV and used Lotrimin cream on the skin. With this treatment, the swelling and redness in the patient's legs improved quickly. Because the patient was urinating often, a test showed that about 600 cc of urine remained in the bladder. To help empty the bladder, a thin tube called a Foley catheter was inserted, and it collected around 500 cc of urine. The patient was given Flomax (a medication) to help with urination. A day later, the Foley catheter was removed, and a test showed that there was still about 60 cc of urine left in the bladder after about eight hours. Currently, the patient can walk a little bit, but not well enough to live independently."
1072,"DIAGNOSIS ON ADMISSION: Gastrointestinal bleed. DIAGNOSES ON DISCHARGE 1. Gastrointestinal bleed, source undetermined, but possibly due to internal hemorrhoids. 2. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 3. Hypothyroidism. PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy. FINDINGS: Poor prep with friable internal hemorrhoids, but no gross lesions, no source of bleed. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the emergency room by Dr. X. He apparently had an NG tube placed in the emergency room with gastric aspirate revealing no blood. Dr. Y Miller saw him in consultation and recommended a colonoscopy. A bowel prep was done. H&Hs were stable. His most recent H&H was 38.6/13.2 that was this morning. His H&H at admission was 41/14.3. The patient had the bowel prep that revealed no significant bleeding. His vital signs are stable. He is continuing on his usual medications of Imdur, metoprolol, and Synthroid. His Plavix is discontinued. He is given IV Protonix. I am hesitant to use Prilosec or Protonix because of his history of pancreatitis associated with Prilosec. The patient's PT/INR was 1.03, PTT 25.8. Chemistry panel was unremarkable. The patient was given a regular diet after his colonoscopy today. He tolerated it well and is being discharged home. He will be followed closely as an outpatient. He will continue his Pepcid 40 mg at night, Imdur, Synthroid, and metoprolol as prior to admission. He will hold his Plavix for now. They will call me for further dark stools and will avoid Pepto-Bismol. They will follow up in the office on Thursday.","When the patient came in, they had a stomach or intestinal bleed. When they left the hospital, they were diagnosed with three things. The first one is a stomach or intestinal bleed. We're not sure where it came from, but it might be because of a problem with blood vessels inside the bottom part of the digestive system. The second diagnosis is a heart disease related to clogged blood vessels. The third diagnosis is an underactive thyroid. They had a procedure called a colonoscopy. During the colonoscopy, they found that the inside of the lower part of the digestive system wasn't prepared very well and had some weak spots in the blood vessels, but they didn't see any big problems or the source of the bleeding. The patient came to the emergency room because of this issue, and Dr. X admitted them to the hospital. In the emergency room, they put a tube through the patient's nose into their stomach to check what was inside. They didn't find any blood in the stomach. Another doctor, Dr. Y Miller, saw the patient and suggested doing a colonoscopy to get a better look inside. We made sure the patient's bowels were clean for the procedure. The patient's blood levels stayed normal. The most recent blood test, done this morning, showed that the patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were 38.6 and 13.2, respectively. When the patient was first admitted, their hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were 41 and 14.3. The patient had a bowel prep, which didn't show any significant bleeding. The patient's vital signs, like heart rate and blood pressure, are steady and normal. The patient is still taking their usual medicines: Imdur, metoprolol, and Synthroid. We stopped giving the patient Plavix. Instead, the patient is getting Protonix through an IV. I'm cautious about using Prilosec or Protonix because the patient had a history of pancreatitis related to Prilosec. The patient's blood tests looked good with numbers like PT/INR at 1.03 and PTT at 25.8. Other blood tests didn't show any problems. After the colonoscopy today, the patient was allowed to eat a regular diet. The patient handled it well and is going back home from the hospital. The doctors will keep a close eye on him in follow-up appointments. He'll keep taking his Pepcid 40 mg at night, Imdur, Synthroid, and metoprolol, just like before he came to the hospital. For now, he won't take Plavix. If he sees more dark stools or has problems, he should contact the doctors, and he shouldn't use Pepto-Bismol. He has a follow-up appointment at the doctor's office on Thursday."
1076,"EXAM: CT abdomen without contrast and pelvis without contrast, reconstruction. REASON FOR EXAM: Right lower quadrant pain, rule out appendicitis. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast CT abdomen and pelvis. An intravenous line could not be obtained for the use of intravenous contrast material. FINDINGS: The appendix is normal. There is a moderate amount of stool throughout the colon. There is no evidence of a small bowel obstruction or evidence of pericolonic inflammatory process. Examination of the extreme lung bases appear clear, no pleural effusions. The visualized portions of the liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and pancreas appear normal given the lack of contrast. There is a small hiatal hernia. There is no intrarenal stone or evidence of obstruction bilaterally. There is a questionable vague region of low density in the left anterior mid pole region, this may indicate a tiny cyst, but it is not well seen given the lack of contrast. This can be correlated with a followup ultrasound if necessary. The gallbladder has been resected. There is no abdominal free fluid or pathologic adenopathy. There is abdominal atherosclerosis without evidence of an aneurysm. Dedicated scans of the pelvis disclosed phleboliths, but no free fluid or adenopathy. There are surgical clips present. There is a tiny airdrop within the bladder. If this patient has not had a recent catheterization, correlate for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection. IMPRESSION: 1. Normal appendix. 2. Moderate stool throughout the colon. 3. No intrarenal stones. 4. Tiny airdrop within the bladder. If this patient has not had a recent catheterization, correlate for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection.

WHY THE TEST: The patient has pain on the right side of the belly, and doctors want to check if it's appendicitis. HOW IT'S DONE: X-ray of the belly and lower pelvis without using any special dye. They couldn't put a needle into a vein for the special dye. RESULT: The appendix looks okay. There's a good amount of stool in the colon. No signs of a blocked small intestine or inflammation around the colon. The very bottom part of the lungs is clear, and there's no liquid around them. The liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and pancreas look normal, but they didn't use any special dye. There's a small hiatal hernia (a kind of stomach issue). No kidney stones or blockages in both kidneys. There's a possible small, unclear area in the left front part of the kidney, which might be a tiny cyst, but it's hard to see without special dye. A follow-up ultrasound can check this if needed. The gallbladder was removed. No abnormal fluid in the belly or swollen lymph nodes. The blood vessels in the belly show some hardening but no balloon-like swelling. Special scans of the lower pelvis found some tiny stone-like formations in the veins but no fluid or swollen lymph nodes. Surgical clips from a previous surgery are still there. A small amount of air is seen in the bladder. If the patient hasn't had a recent catheter, check for signs of a urinary tract infection. Summary: The appendix is normal. There's quite a bit of stool in the colon. No kidney stones. A small amount of air in the bladder. If the patient hasn't had a recent catheter, check for signs of a urinary tract infection. The report was sent by fax right after it was written down."

1083,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Biliary colic and biliary dyskinesia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Biliary colic and biliary dyskinesia. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISPOSITION: The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery in stable condition. BRIEF HISTORY: This patient is a 42-year-old female who presented to Dr. X's office with complaints of upper abdominal and back pain, which was sudden onset for couple of weeks. The patient is also diabetic. The patient had a workup for her gallbladder, which showed evidence of biliary dyskinesia. The patient was then scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy for biliary colic and biliary dyskinesia. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient's abdomen was explored. There was no evidence of any peritoneal studding or masses. The abdomen was otherwise within normal limits. The gallbladder was easily visualized. There was an intrahepatic gallbladder. There was no evidence of any inflammatory change. PROCEDURE: After informed written consent, the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient. The patient was brought into the operating suite. After general endotracheal intubation, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion. Next, an infraumbilical incision was made with a #10 scalpel. The skin was elevated with towel clips and a Veress needle was inserted. The abdomen was then insufflated to 15 mmHg of pressure. The Veress needle was removed and a #10 blade trocar was inserted without difficulty. The laparoscope was then inserted through this #10 port and the abdomen was explored. There was no evidence of any peritoneal studding. The peritoneum was smooth. The gallbladder was intrahepatic somewhat. No evidence of any inflammatory change. There were no other abnormalities noted in the abdomen. Next, attention was made to placing the epigastric #10 port, which again was placed under direct visualization without difficulty. The two #5 ports were placed, one in the midclavicular and one in the anterior axillary line again in similar fashion under direct visualization. The gallbladder was then grasped out at its fundus, elevated to patient's left shoulder. Using a curved dissector, the cystic duct was identified and freed up circumferentially. Next, an Endoclip was used to distal and proximal to the gallbladder, Endoshears were used in between to transect the cystic duct. The cystic artery was transected in similar fashion. Attention was next made in removing the gallbladder from the liver bed using electrobovie cautery and spatulated tip. It was done without difficulty. The gallbladder was then grasped via the epigastric port and removed without difficulty and sent to pathology. Hemostasis was maintained using electrobovie cautery. The liver bed was then copiously irrigated and aspirated. All the fluid and air was then aspirated and then all ports were removed under direct visualization. The two #10 ports were then closed in the fascia with #0 Vicryl and a UR6 needle. The skin was closed with a running subcuticular #4-0 undyed Vicryl. 0.25% Marcaine was injected and Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to Recovery in stable condition.","Before Surgery Diagnosis: The patient had pain from gallbladder problems. After Surgery Diagnosis: The patient still had pain from gallbladder problems. Procedure Done: A surgery to remove the gallbladder was performed using small incisions. Type of Anesthesia: The patient was put to sleep with general anesthesia. Complications: No issues or problems happened during the surgery. Outcome: The patient did well during the surgery and was moved to the recovery area in a stable condition. Brief History: A 42-year-old woman complained to the doctor about sudden pain in her upper abdomen and back that had been going on for a few weeks. She also has diabetes. Additional Information: The patient has diabetes. Gallbladder Testing: Tests on the gallbladder showed a problem called biliary dyskinesia.

Adding Another Tube: Another tube was put in just above the stomach, and this was also done without any problems. Adding More Tubes: Two more small tubes were put in, one near the middle of the chest and the other in a line near the front of the shoulder, just like before. Getting the Gallbladder Out: The gallbladder was carefully taken out and lifted up toward the patient's left shoulder. Working on a Tube: A special tool was used to find and free up a tube called the cystic duct. Cutting and Clipping: Clips and scissors were used to cut the cystic duct and a blood vessel called the cystic artery. Cutting the Blood Vessel: The blood vessel was cut in a similar way. Removing the Gallbladder: Next, the gallbladder was removed from where it was stuck to the liver using a special tool and a cautery tool. No Problems Removing It: This was done without any trouble. Taking Out the Gallbladder: The gallbladder was held using one of the tubes and taken out without problems. It was sent for testing. Stopping Any Bleeding: Special tools were used to stop any bleeding. Cleaning Up: The liver area was washed and any liquid or air was removed. Taking Out the Tubes: All the tubes were taken out while the surgeon could see them. Closing the Holes: The holes left by the tubes were closed in the muscles with special thread. Closing the Skin: The skin was closed with more special thread. Pain Relief and Dressing: Pain-relieving medicine was given, and the wounds were covered with bandages. Outcome: The patient did well during the procedure and was moved to the recovery area in stable condition."
1084,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Protein-calorie malnutrition. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Protein-calorie malnutrition. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. ANESTHESIA: Conscious sedation per Anesthesia. SPECIMEN: None. COMPLICATIONS: None. HISTORY: The patient is a 73-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital with some mentation changes. He was unable to sustain enough caloric intake and had markedly decreased albumin stores. After discussion with the patient and the son, they agreed to place a PEG tube for nutritional supplementation. PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the endoscopy suite. He was placed in the supine position and was given IV sedation by the Anesthesia Department. An EGD was performed from above by Dr. X. The stomach was transilluminated and an optimal position for the PEG tube was identified using the single poke method. The skin was infiltrated with local anesthesia and the needle and sheath were inserted through the abdomen into the stomach under direct visualization. The needle was removed and a guidewire was inserted through the sheath. The guidewire was grasped from above with a snare by the endoscopist. It was removed completely and the Ponsky PEG tube was secured to the guidewire. The guidewire and PEG tube were then pulled through the mouth and esophagus and snug to the abdominal wall. There was no evidence of bleeding. Photos were taken. The Bolster was placed on the PEG site. A complete dictation for the EGD will be done separately by Dr. X. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition. He will be started on tube feedings in 6 hours with aspiration precautions and dietary to determine his nutritional goal.","What the doctor thought the problem was before the surgery: Lack of protein and calories in the body. What the doctor found after the surgery: Still not enough protein and calories. What they did during the surgery: Inserted a tube into the stomach using a special tool. Type of medicine used during the surgery: Medication to make the patient relaxed but not fully asleep. No samples were taken during the surgery. There were no problems during or after the surgery. About the patient: A 73-year-old man came to the hospital because he was having trouble thinking clearly. He couldn't eat enough food and had very little albumin in his body. After talking to the patient and his son, they decided to put a tube in his stomach to help him get more nutrition. What they did: They got permission from the patient and then took him to a special room. He lay on his back, and the Anesthesia Department gave him medicine through an IV to make him relaxed. Dr. X used a special tool to look inside the patient's stomach from above. They shone a light through the stomach and found the best place to put the tube using a method that only needed one hole. They numbed the skin with local anesthesia and put a needle and tube through the belly into the stomach while looking at it. They took out the needle and put a thin wire through the tube. The doctor up top used a special tool to grab the wire. They pulled the wire out, and the PEG tube was attached to it. They pulled the wire and tube out through the mouth and throat and secured it against the belly. There was no bleeding. They took pictures. They placed a thing called a Bolster on the PEG site. Dr. X will write a full report about the stomach part of the procedure separately. The patient did well during the procedure and was taken to the recovery room in good condition. In 6 hours, they will start feeding the patient through the tube, and they'll be careful to prevent choking, figuring out how much food he needs."
1093,"EXAM: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis without and with intravenous contrast. CLINICAL INDICATION: Left lower quadrant abdominal pain. COMPARISON: None. FINDINGS: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed without and with intravenous contrast. Total of 100 mL of Isovue was administered intravenously. Oral contrast was also administered. The lung bases are clear. The liver is enlarged and decreased in attenuation. There are no focal liver masses. There is no intra or extrahepatic ductal dilatation. The gallbladder is slightly distended. The adrenal glands, pancreas, spleen, and left kidney are normal. A 12-mm simple cyst is present in the inferior pole of the right kidney. There is no hydronephrosis or hydroureter. The appendix is normal. There are multiple diverticula in the rectosigmoid. There is evidence of focal wall thickening in the sigmoid colon (image #69) with adjacent fat stranding in association with a diverticulum. These findings are consistent with diverticulitis. No pneumoperitoneum is identified. There is no ascites or focal fluid collection. The aorta is normal in contour and caliber. There is no adenopathy. Degenerative changes are present in the lumbar spine. IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with diverticulitis. Please see report above.","TEST: Picture of the belly and lower pelvis using a CT scan, with and without a special liquid. WHY: Checking for pain in the left lower part of the belly. COMPARE: No past scans to compare with. RESULTS: The CT scan took pictures of the belly and pelvis, both with and without using a special liquid. Liquid called Isovue was put into a vein, about 100 mL in total. They also made you drink some liquid. Your lungs look fine. The liver is bigger than normal and not as bright as it should be. No lumps found in the liver. No swelling in the tubes inside or outside the liver. The gallbladder is a bit puffed up. The adrenal glands, pancreas, spleen, and left kidney are all normal. There's a small 12-mm liquid-filled bump in the lower part of the right kidney. Your kidney and urinary tubes don't have any extra swelling or water buildup. The tube-shaped structure in your belly called the ""appendix"" looks normal. There are many small pockets in the lower part of your intestine. In one part of the colon, the wall seems thicker in the picture (#69), and there's some fat around a pocket, which could mean diverticulitis. These results suggest you might have diverticulitis. No air inside your belly. No unusual collections of fluid. The main blood vessel in your body, the aorta, looks fine in shape and size. No swollen lymph nodes. Your lower back spine shows signs of wear and tear. Summary: You likely have diverticulitis based on these findings. Please read the report above for more details."
